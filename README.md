# JDBC
A simple Java application to demonstrate JDBC connectivity and  performing a basic insert operation into a MySQL database.
 
  1. Loads the MySQL JDBC driver.
  2. Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
  3. Creates a prepared statement for inserting data into a table.
  4. Prompts the user for input (name and city).
  5. Inserts the provided data into the database.
  6. Verifies if the data insertion was successful.
  Note: Update the database URL, username, and password as needed.
 
 **IMP** Ensure that the MySQL JDBC driver (mysql-connector-java) is included in the classpath.
 
   Usage: Run the program and follow the prompts to enter the name and city.
